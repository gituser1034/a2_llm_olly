Model: 
Q1. The solar system is approximately 4.6 billion years old.  
A1. True - the notes state "Solar system around 4.6 billion years old".  

Q2. Galaxies typically form disc-shaped structures.  
A2. True - the notes specify "Galaxies like discs".  

Q3. Rock can remain solid at higher temperatures than ice.  
A3. True - the notes indicate "Rock can be solid much higher temp then ice".  

Q4. Angular momentum increases as a collapsing gas cloud spins faster.  
A4. True - the notes explain "Rotation increased, increase of angular momentum, as cloud collapses".  

Q5. Stars form through the collapse of isolated gas clouds in space.  
A5. False - the notes state "Gas clouds collapsing, big gas clouds collapse into numerous stars", meaning stars form from collapsing clouds, not isolation.  

Q6. Planets in our solar system formed from the same gas and dust cloud as the Sun.  
A6. True - the notes confirm "shared origin, planets formed together, at the same time" from the solar nebula.  

Q7. The inner regions of the solar system are dominated by gas and ice.  
A7. False - the notes state "rock in hot area, gas and ice in outer solar system", meaning gas/ice are outer regions.  

Q8. Stellar life cycles involve "galactic recycling" where dead stars fuel new star formation.  
A8. True - the notes describe "Galactic recycling, Stars form, blows up fueling more stars".  

Q9. Conservation of energy causes the center of a collapsing cloud to become hotter.  
A9. True - the notes mention "Conservation of energy, gravity causing contraction, hot, inner hotter then outer".  

Q10. All stars form independently without interacting with other stars.  
A10. False - the notes indicate "big gas clouds collapse into numerous stars, get star clusters", showing star formation in groups.  

Q11. The solar system formed after the Big Bang.  
A11. False - the notes provide an age ("4.6 billion years old") but do not reference the Big Bang timeline, so this is not supported by the given material.  

Q12. Angular momentum conservation flattens collapsing gas clouds into discs.  
A12. True - the notes state "as cloud collapsing, spins more, flattens to disc shape (aka circumstellar disc)".  

Q13. New stars form at a rate of one per year in the Milky Way.  
A13. False - the notes mention "New star born a year" but this is likely a misstatement; the context implies star formation occurs continuously, not exactly one per year.  

Q14. Planets form after their host stars have already completed their life cycles.  
A14. False - the notes state "planets formed together, at the same time" with the Sun, meaning simultaneous formation.  

Q15. Observing other planetary systems helps understand our solar system's formation.  
A15. True - the notes confirm "Can watch how other planets form from other solar nebulas and use that to tell how our solar system formed".

Model:
Q1. Stars form from collapsing gas clouds due to gravity.  
A1. True - gravity causes gas clouds to collapse into stars.  

Q2. As a gas cloud collapses, its rotation speed decreases.  
A2. False - conservation of angular momentum increases rotation speed during collapse.  

Q3. The solar system formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago.  
A3. True - the solar system is about 4.6 billion years old.  

Q4. Planets in our solar system formed at the same time from the same material.  
A4. True - planets formed together from the solar nebula.  

Q5. Galactic recycling involves stars exploding to fuel the formation of new stars.  
A5. True - stars blow up, releasing material that fuels subsequent star formation.  

Q6. The inner regions of a collapsing gas cloud are hotter than the outer regions.  
A6. True - gravitational contraction heats the inner parts more than the outer.  

Q7. Ice can exist at higher temperatures than rock in the solar system.  
A7. False - rock solidifies at much higher temperatures than ice, so rock forms closer to the sun.  

Q8. Star nurseries are regions where new stars form from collapsing gas clouds.  
A8. True - star nurseries (nebulas) are sites of active star formation.  

Q9. Galaxies typically have a spherical shape due to gravitational collapse.  
A9. False - galaxies form disc-like structures as angular momentum flattens collapsing clouds.  

Q10. The solar system is the only known system with planets forming from a nebula.  
A10. False - hundreds of exoplanets orbiting other stars confirm nebular formation elsewhere.  

Q11. Angular momentum determines how fast an object spins.  
A11. True - angular momentum directly relates to rotational speed.  

Q12. All stars form in clusters without any disc structures.  
A12. False - collapsing gas clouds flatten into discs (circumstellar discs) before star formation.  

Q13. The outer solar system contains primarily solid rock material.  
A13. False - the outer solar system has gas and ice, not solid rock.  

Q14. Galactic recycling stops after a star completes its life cycle.  
A14. False - galactic recycling is continuous, with star deaths fueling new star formation.
